## Experimental features

Experimental features are published as part of our regular releases (e.g. a product
public beta). During an experimental phase, breaking changes on those features may occur
within minor releases.

While experimental features will be announced in the release notes, you can also find
whether a command is experimental in its help text. Using experimental commands will show a warning
when running them. You can suppress this warning by enabling the `no-experimental-warnings` option.
