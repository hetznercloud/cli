# Developing hcloud-cli

## Generated files

This repository contains generated files, mainly for testing purposes. These files are generated by running

```sh
go generate ./...
```

in the root directory of this repository. Make sure to keep generated files up-to-date
when making changes to the code.

## Unit tests

Unit tests are located in the `internal` directory. Run them with:

```sh
go test ./...
```

## Build

To build the binary, run:

```sh
go build -o hcloud-cli ./cmd/hcloud
```

To include version information in the resulting binary and build for all targets, use GoReleaser:

```sh
goreleaser --snapshot --skip-publish --rm-dist
```

## Conventions

### Subcommand groups

Cobra offers the functionality to group subcommands. The conventions on when and how to group commands are as follows:

1. Use the following Categories:
    - **General** (CRUD operations such as `create`, `delete`, `describe`, `list`, `update` + Label
      commands `add-`/`remove-label`)
    - Groups based on actions (e.g. `enable`, `disable`, `attach`, `detach`), for example `enable-`/`disable-protection`
      or `poweron`/`poweroff`/`shutdown`/`reset`/`reboot`
    - **Additional commands** that don't fit into the other categories (`Group.ID` is empty). These should be
      utility commands, for example ones that perform client-side actions.
2. Groups are only needed if more than the "General" group commands are present.
3. `Group.ID` formatting:
    1. If the `ID` is a noun, it should be singular.
    2. If the `ID` is a verb, it should be in the infinitive form.
    3. The `ID` should be in kebab-case.
4. `Group.Title` formatting:
    1. Should be the `ID` but capitalized and with spaces instead of dashes.
    2. If a single resource is managed, the `Title` should be singular. Otherwise, it should be plural.

       Example: Multiple network can be attached to server -> `Networks`, but only one ISO can be attached to a server -> `ISO`

Here is how to create a group:

```go
cmd.AddGroup(&cobra.Group{ID: "general", Title: "General"})
// ...

cmd.AddCommand(
util.WithGroup("general", ListCmd.CobraCommand(s)),
// ...
)
```
